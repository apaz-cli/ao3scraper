<p>Whumptober Prompt No. 25 | Storm</p><p align="center">.</p><p>Lan Jingyi always liked to say that you should never remark on how things were going well, because that would only ever result in things falling apart.</p><p>It was too bad Ouyang Zizhen had never heard of the phrase.</p><p>Of course, Sizhui has practically watched the belief develop along with Jingyi himself, and Jin Ling has heard it far more than heâd like, but Ouyang Zizhen is still a bit of a newcomer to the group. They hadnât really met until Yi City, but he fits so naturally into their dynamic sometimes it almost feels as if heâs always been a part.</p><p>Except in moments like this.</p><p>Jingyi immediately elbows him in the side, prompting a yelp from Zizhen, but the boyâs expression, slightly blurred from the mist, seems more confused than angry.</p><p>âAhâwhat was that for?â</p><p>Lan Sizhui bites back a sigh.</p><p>He knows he should reprimand Lan Jingyi. Even though Jin Ling technically outranks him, Sizhui is the one Hanguang-Jun put in charge of the night hunt. The one he'd trusted to keep everyone under control. But itâs been three long days of investigation, two nearly sleepless nights, and heâs having a difficult time thinking of anything but how good it will feel to collapse into his warm bed.</p><p>The damp, misty forest air around him is already making his eyes burn. Jingyi, only a few paces ahead, looks like a ghost, and Ouyang Zizhenâs dark robes are nearly swallowed up by the shadows of the forest.</p><p>âYou canât say âeverything will be easy nowâ because now something will go wrong!â Lan Jingyi hisses. The lantern in his hand swings wildly as he shoves at Zizhen again.</p><p>The other boyâs face falls. âOh. Wellâ¦ it canât get that bad, since weâve already taken care of the issue. We just need to get back to the Cloud Recesses, and weâll be fine, right?â</p><p>Beside him, Jin Ling scoffs. âItâs just a dumb superstition. Come on, itâs freezing out.â</p><p>âOf course the young mistress can only think of the cold,â Lan Jingyi shoots back. Jin Ling glares at him.</p><p>Lan Sizhui swallows the yawn that's building in his throat, finally willing himself to speak. âJin Ling is right. Itâs cold, and itâs getting late. A-DieâI mean, Hanguang-Jun wants us back before curfew.â</p><p>He stumbles a bit over that word, not sure if he used the correct term of address. Everything feels so different than it had been just a few months ago.</p><p>Now he remembers his past, at least bits and pieces of it. He remembers he used to call Hanguang-Jun ârich-gege,â before Lan Wangji had taken him in, had become âA-Die.â</p><p>But heâs older now, and the correct term of address is âHanguang-Jun.â</p><p>Not âA-Die.â</p><p>Hanguang-Jun.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye he sees Lan Jingyi looking at him, and quickly pushes aside his thoughts, giving his friend a smile before Jingyi can ask whatâs wrong.</p><p>His shidi has already gotten into enough trouble for him, has worried enough for him.</p><p>âMaybe Wei-qianbei will make us some food when we get back,â Lan Sizhui says, keeping his tone light. He manages to even laugh a little when Jin Ling fake-gags in response.</p><p>The mist grows thicker as they travel higher into the mountains, but Jin Lingâs bright yellow robes are like a flare, one that they all huddle around like moths. And if Lan Jingyi presses a little close to Ouyang Zizhen, shivering, if Sizhui fails to stifle a jaw-cracking yawn, if Jin Ling stumbles over nothing and lets out a quiet curse, no one says anything. Theyâre all too exhausted, too focused on finding some clearing where they can mount their swords and fly the rest of the way.</p><p>Besides the occasional noise from Jin Ling, the group is silent, opening the way for Lan Sizhuiâs thoughts to come creeping back. Memories of the events of Yi City and beyond, that heâs still struggling to untangle. Many of those memories are pleasant, like Zizhen joining their trio. Wei Wuxian coming back.</p><p>Some are more complicated, like the trip heâd taken with Wen Ning to gather their familyâs ashes. The memories of his early life are sti
